# Simple Quiz Frontend

A minimal, standalone quiz app that runs entirely in the browser. No backend, no build step, no npm.

## How to Run

1. Open `index.html` in your browser:
   - Double-click the file, or
   - Right-click → Open with → Chrome / Edge / Firefox, or
   - Drag the file into a browser window

2. That’s it. No server or installation required.

## What It Does

- **Enter** — Type your name and click “Enter” to start.
- **Quiz list** — Two sample quizzes; click “Start” on any one.
- **Take quiz** — Countdown timer, progress bar, multiple-choice questions (shuffled).
- **Results** — Score and correct/wrong summary. Submit manually or wait for the timer to auto-submit.
- **Back** — “Back to quizzes” returns to the list; “Leave” clears your name and returns to the start.

## Tech

- Single HTML file with inline CSS and JavaScript.
- Mock quiz data (no API or database).
- Works offline once the file is loaded.

## File

- `index.html` — Contains the full app (markup, styles, script, and sample quizzes).
